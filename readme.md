We believe in keeping things human, straightforward, and fair—not bogged down by bureaucracy, but alive with real connection. With a clear structure that values both flexibility and resilience, we’re crafting a Manifesto built to endure. Over time, our core values and principles have drifted, and now, we are focused on returning to our roots, rebuilding a shared foundation, and uniting what’s become divided. Born from the community and shaped by those who build, this work is for everyone. We’re on equal footing, building a shared future for the Fellowship together. Our Manifesto and referenda are shaped through open, thoughtful discussions where every voice counts, ensuring that individual insights and perspectives are truly represented.

The Ambassador Fellowship and Ambassador Program 2.0 each bring distinct strengths, tailored to different priorities and styles of engagement. The Ambassador Fellowship is rooted in a community focused philosophy, emphasising flexibility, adaptability, and broad engagement. It operates with a dynamic framework, allowing for consensus-based governance and a non-hierarchical structure where merit-based recognition is central. This approach values adaptability and inclusivity, making it well-suited for environments that thrive on community input and collaborative decision-making. However, it does not focus on technical initiatives and does not offer fixed salaries for ambassadors.

Ultimately, the Ambassador Fellowship is tailored for a community-driven and flexible environment. Resilient to the core, the framework has been constructed to serve Polkadot today, tomorrow and for the long-term successful future ahead.

| **Learning from the Past, Clear Vision for the Future**                                                                                                                                                                                    | **Rooting Values and Principles**                                                                                                                                               | **Collaboration Instead of Competition**                                                                                                                                                            |

| The Ambassadors' chronicle reaches back many years. Key learnings from the past help us forge a clear vision for what is to come—what we need, want and must achieve—all derived from the past. This allows us to learn from our mistakes. | Initial values were  changed, principles scattered and spread wide apart. We work to return to our roots, rebuild values and principles and unite what once was divided.        | Together we stand, divided we fall. We bring back a culture of community as the core. We work together, not against one another. We listen, support, and ensure that those who come will also stay. |
| **Grassroots, But with Structure**                                                                                                                                                                                                         | **From the Community, For the Community**                                                                                                                                       | **A Door to Many Paths and Worlds**                                                                                                                                                                 |
| We keep things human, simple, and fair. Not bureaucracy, but lively engagement with some organisation. And yet, we keep structure and common sense—flexible but solid, growing yet resilient, a manifesto to stand the tides of time.      | We are people like you and me, coming together. A community, for the community. From builders, for builders. We meet on equal terms, and equally build the Fellowship’s future. | The Ambassadors community is a starting point—an open door to many journeys. Start here, find your path, get guidance, and make connections. Wherever you go, we’re with you.                       |
