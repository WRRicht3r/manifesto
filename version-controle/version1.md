# Polkadot Ambassador Fellowship Manifesto
### DRAFT v.1

The Polkadot Community Voices

Abstract. The Ambassador Fellowship is a rules-based ranked-membership organisation administered, and empowered through blockchain logic hosted on the Polkadot Network. In this paper, the goals of the organisation are discussed. Its bylaws and membership rules are specified, relevant conventions described and a new funding mechanism is proposed.


1. Background 

1.1 Introduction


As the decentralisation of the Polkadot Network advances, responsibilities once managed by centralised entities must now be handled through decentralised methods. Along with this shift, new challenges will emerge that need to be identified and addressed. This article offers technical and social solutions to tackle these challenges, aiming to minimise the influence of any single participant and give token holders greater control over defining needs, choosing solutions, and supporting them.

This manifesto draws on the core ideas of the Polkadot Fellowship Manifesto to suggest a new framework for an Ambassador Fellowship. Though aligned with the original manifesto's values, it addresses the unique challenges faced by this new group. It is designed to be a modest but meaningful addition to the existing framework.

While staying true to the original spirit, this proposal introduces significant changes to reflect differences in scope, candidate selection, and the evolving challenges faced by the previous Ambassador Programmes members and communities. This manifesto is a product of the community intended to best serve the community now and in the future. By acknowledging past contributions and newer concepts, 
we will pave the way for future achievements.

1.2 Definition

Staying true to its core values and embracing decentralisation, the Polkadot Network creates the unprecedented need to rely on and support a broad network of agents and communities to accomplish various tasks and objectives - many of which remain to be identified by token holders.  This approach creates an urgent need for a robust reputation system to recognise and highlight valuable contributors. Not only will this acknowledge their efforts, but it will also improve the visibility of these key contributors both within and outside the network.


These unique challenges require the creation of a more dynamic programme - one that evolves beyond the traditional models to support agents and communities. While the programme scope should remain broad, the main goal is to provide support in four key areas:


Legitimacy
Recognition
Funding 
Inclusion in initiatives 

The programme must offer straightforward solutions to provide those resources efficiently, empowering participants to identify and address the needs of the network. Since these needs will evolve unpredictably, the program should be designed in such a way that the token holders retain control over the Ambassador Fellowship’s purpose and objectives, ensuring flexibility and adaptability.

Token holders should resist efforts to impose regulation, hierarchy, or bureaucracy, the Ambassador Fellowship should remain resilient by design, scalable to demand and secure in nature, without compromising its integrity. 

1.3 Problems faced

While the Ambassador Fellowship does not impact the core functionality of the Polkadot Network, its value lies in mastering the core components of a strong community and empowering agents to identify and tackle non-technical issues that the Polkadot Network faces. The social aspect it addresses is vital, yet expectations vary as widely as they do token holders. 

Due to the multifaceted purpose of this global mission, the programme must deviate from the standards set by the Technical Fellowship, which must favour quality over quantity, and strike a better balance between the technically educated and experienced and the passionate and knowledge hungry. There will be no cap on the number of individuals that can join the Ambassador Fellowship, nor a cap on any rank. To achieve a dedicated, global body burgeoning with talent, enthusiasm and a drive to make Polkadot unstoppable, the programme must be infinitely scalable, easily adaptable, empowering to the community with localised solutions and require minimal maintenance. 

The Ambassador Fellowship resilience is critical for success under these metrics, so a separation between rank and funding is crucial. 


1.4 Ranked-based membership system

We propose a new, merit-based, ranking system for individuals. The system will recognise all individuals that add value to the ecosystem, giving them legitimacy and incentivising future work. By doing so, token holders can delegate representation of the Polkadot Network to these trusted actors. 

The true challenge is to fabricate an inclusive system that welcomes past, present, and future members whilst accounting for their diverse visions, skills, and levels of involvement. The ranking system should be reflective of the ambitious goals of the Ambassador Fellowship and the Polkadot Network itself, offering a clear path of advancement with increasingly rigorous criteria. 

Although the intention behind the Ambassador Fellowship is to install a resilient system requiring minimal management in line with the decentralised future of the Polkadot Network, it must also be a system that supports and nurtures leadership. Management and leadership are two separate functions. In the early establishment of this initially complex process, both will be required to achieve a smooth landing, but over time, the former should retract and make way for an increasingly strong set of leaders, both individuals, sub-communities, specialist programme initiators. 

1.5 Funding mechanism 

Whilst the Polkadot Network has an open governance system, which provides many opportunities to support the needs of the Ambassador Fellowship, it is also a framework that welcomes evolution dictated by token holders' experiences, challenges, and future goals. In addition to the ranked membership system, we propose a new funding mechanism designed to attract solution providers, easing their participation while lessening the overall burden on OpenGov.
 
Given the unpredictable nature of the Polkadot ecosystem's future needs, the program must be structured to ensure token holders remain in charge of the core mission and objectives of the Ambassador Fellowship.
The individuals operating within the Ambassador Fellowship and the programme itself should be highly regarded within the Polkadot Network. As the programme grows, the reliance on its members to boost the global presence and perception of the Polkadot Network should become more heavily weighted. Due to this recognition and reward will play a central role in the programme, ensuring that everyone who contributes to the fellowship is fairly compensated for their time and efforts. While the ranks within the programme will not come with fixed salaries, there will be financial rewards, incentives, and access to necessary funds to support the ambitions and initiatives of the fellowship’s members.
To ensure long-term sustainability, we are intentionally separating the rank structure from the financial mechanisms. This uncoupling is designed to give the programme the best chance of thriving over time, allowing for flexibility in its structure and function.
Additionally, there will be a clear distinction between automatic payments and requested payments. This financial mechanism will operate in harmony with the Ambassador Fellowship, as outlined in the manifesto, ensuring that rewards and support are aligned with the fellowship's evolving goals and the broader needs of the ecosystem.
Ultimately, given the unpredictable nature of the Polkadot ecosystem’s future needs, the program must be built to ensure that token holders remain in control of the core mission and objectives of the agent program, while enabling continuous growth and adaptation.

2. Summary

The Ambassador Fellowship is a global initiative dedicated to fostering a community that is passionate about the vision of a decentralized web, true interoperability, and the potential of blockchain to transform our digital lives. It is a commitment to building the future of the decentralised web. 
Mirroring the mission of the protocol itself, it will be scalable, secure and resilient. 




2.1 Vision

Our vision is to create the largest on-chain, decentralised community in the world, anchored in vibrancy, and empowerment around a fiercely resilient core.

3. Code of Conduct

Ambassador Fellowship members are expected to faithfully uphold the following tenets. Clarifications to the rules should be in agreement with these tenets. Acting in clear breach of these tenets may be considered by voters as grounds for non-promotion, demotion, or, in extreme cases, exclusion from the Ambassador Fellowship. (1) Sincerely uphold the interests of Polkadot and avoid actions that clearly work against it. (2) Respect the philosophy and principles of Polkadot. (3) Respect the operational procedures, norms, and voting conventions of the Ambassador Fellowship. (4) Respect your fellow members and the community in general, seeking to act at all times with integrity and professionalism in your interactions.

4. Operational Rules 

The operational rules of the Ambassador Fellowship governing how its membership evolves are detailed below. These rules specify the process for becoming a member, attaining a rank, and maintaining it. During the initial bootstrapping phase, some rules may be relaxed to expedite decentralisation and ensure pluralism in the member judgement process as early as possible. Specifically, it may be reasonable to have shortened voting timelines and remove the need for some peripheral, demonstrative requirements if and only if it is obvious that the candidate in question possesses the relevant technical knowledge. In all cases, time limits on ranks should still generally be respected. This leniency, such as it is, should exist only for the initial bootstrapping phase. By the first continuation grading, the full expectations of the member’s rank should be met for approval by voters. Note, as per the tenets, the voting of Members is expected to follow the conventions and bylaws of the Ambassador Fellowship and in particular the Rank Specifications. 

Ambassadors are expected to have achieved different levels of work and outcomes to be promoted to the next rank.
There are no limits to the number of Ambassadors at any rank
Ranks can be skipped if higher milestones are achieved which are a superset of smaller milestones, although it is generally recommended that Ambassadors aim to move through all ranks one by one.


4.1. Entry

Evangelist ambassadors can be onboarded into the program by any individual in the Fellowship, including those from the same rank.

Ambassadors can be onboarded into any rank through public referendum, however, this should be primarily used for the initial seeding of the program

4.2. Promotion

Any Member may request their own promotion.

Promotion process: 

All Members of one rank greater than the prospective (post-promotion) rank are invited to approve or reject the request.
The window for voting is open for one month. 
There must be a majority of rank-weighted votes in favour of the promotion to be approved.
If no members exist with a high enough rank to affirm the promotion (always the case for promotion to rank VII), then a general referendum of the Polkadot governance system must approve the promotion.
If the promotion is approved, their associated rank is incremented by one. 

To be promoted to the next rank, you need a majority vote of ambassadors who are one rank higher than you. For example:

To become a Junior Ambassador from an Evangelist, you must get a majority vote of Ambassadors and higher
To become a Senior Ambassador from Lead Ambassador, you must have a majority vote of Head Ambassadors and Grand Ambassadors
To become a Grand Ambassador, you must pass a public referendum since there are no ranks higher than you. If there are no Grand Ambassadors at the time of promotion for a Senior Ambassador to Head Ambassador, there will be a public referendum.

By majority vote, we mean of those who vote, not of all potential voters. We cannot expect everyone to vote in every promotion. There should just be more people saying yes than saying no.

4.3. Demotion and Removal 

Other than the Head Ambassador and Grand Ambassador role, there should not be any demotions once the ambassador has achieved a certain role whilst the ambassador remains within the Polkadot ecosystem. The role describes the past contributions to Polkadot and the Ambassador Fellowship. Once the ambassador has a role you are a Senior Ambassador, you can be a Senior Ambassador forever without necessarily contributing at the level you were before. Ideally, we encourage all ambassadors to stay as contributors to the ecosystem with any amount of time they can spare. If an individual leaves the ecosystem completely, for a period of more than 12 months, they will be demoted to level I, Evangelist, but not removed.

For Head Ambassadors and Grand Ambassadors, we should expect these individuals to be active in our ecosystem. It would be expected that if a Head Ambassador leaves the ecosystem, we downgrade them to a level I, Evangelist, as with other ranks. 

The only way any Ambassador may lose their rank entirely is through being found to have acted contrary to Polkadot’s interests through a general Polkadot referendum. An individual can of course resign from their rank at any time.

4.4. Rank Voting 

Voting will happen through cumulative rank voting. This simply means that Ambassador Fellowship member votes are weighted by their rank as an item in the geometric series. 

Ambassadors at Rank I, Evangelists, will not be able to vote. Rank II-VII, Junior Ambassador to Grand Ambassador will have their votes weighted as follows:

Junior Ambassador = 
Ambassador = 
Lead Ambassador = 
Senior Ambassador = 
Head Ambassador = 
Grand Ambassador = 

Members of the Ambassador Fellowship should be expected to vote on a number of decisions depending on the needs of the collective. Examples of where voting required:

Promotions
Programme spending
Programme alterations

4.5. Evaluation and Reporting

In digital systems, decisions made by people on the network are designed to be clear and without confusion. But in social systems, like legal, education, or corporate rankings, making consistent and fair judgments is much more difficult. Balancing the intentions of rule-makers with the need for clarity is tricky, and there have been many times in recent history where this balance has failed. In this work, we focus on the technical aspects of blockchain technology. However, when it comes to evaluating people, we can’t make all decisions completely objective. Voters will still need to make judgement calls. To address this, we encourage discussion and provide a clear framework to guide voters. This framework will be adjusted over time and has two main parts: general considerations for all ranks and specific criteria for each rank. The rank-specific details are in Section 6, while this section covers the general points.

4.5.2.  Fellowship Contributions
There will be a wide and constantly evolving range of contributions that an individual can make for the promotion of the Polkadot Network, but to be promoted up the ranks there should be an increasing input for the betterment of the programme from its members. For example:

Plentiful teaching, education, and rational advocacy are a crucial part of moving through the later ranks
The individual has actively promoted and grown the programme, both by recruiting, onboarding and assisting in the promotion of new members
Regularly voting as part of the programme to assist the efficiency of the promotion period and other mechanisms which require Ambassadors to vote. Increased voting should be reflected in increasing ranks


4.5.3. Social Interactions
These are consideration points when evaluating social interactions with other members. Once again, to be evaluated comparatively to other members already of the prospective rank
The individual can listen, comprehend, and form an effective dialectic
The individual avoids ego, pointless argumentation or repeatedly pushing against an answered point. 
The individual is not afraid of calmly and succinctly challenging others when doing so would lead to them having a greater understanding of the world.
The individual is persistently and consistently making themselves available for the support of the network.

5.2. Ranking Requirements 

Creating broader categories of engagement for the Ambassador Fellowship ranking system will act to guide participants through a progressive journey, from passive learning to active and meaningful contributions. These levels help structure the Ambassador's growth and can be tied to increasing responsibilities, incentives, and impact. The importance of having such a range in which an individual can engage with the Fellowship lies in building a programme that will be resilient to outside factors such as directional changes within Polkadot, talent pool fluxes, economic pressures. The programme should be open to all Polkadot enthusiasts and embrace the vibrancy of ideas and energy which that will bring.

There is one absolute requirement for an individual to begin their journey with the Ambassador Fellowship. They must become registered on-chain. To do this, they will take the following steps:

Open a wallet, become verified, lock 1 DOT
Select a sponsor from rank 1, Junior Ambassador, or above
Introduce themselves in the Polkadot Forum

We will provide simple guidelines to walk individuals through each step to ensure the barrier to entry makes this Fellowship accessible to all.

5.2.1. Evangelist 
Listening and Learning

This is the beginning rank and indicates someone new to the Polkadot, but who has taken the first concrete step through placing a membership deposit, verifying their identity on-chain, and finding a sponsor.  At this stage, individuals are familiarising themselves with the brand, its values, and the program objectives. Their role is primarily focused on observation, internalising knowledge, and building their foundation; passive engagement, mainly absorbing information.

Example Actions:
Attend X number of onboarding or training webinars.
Follow all brand social media channels and engage passively - likes, views.
Complete a brand knowledge quiz or assessment.
Engage in community discussions or forums without necessarily contributing significantly, such as reading and liking posts.

5.2.2 Junior Ambassador 
Learning with Moderate Contributions

Ambassadors begin to move beyond passive participation. They are expected to engage actively but at a moderate pace, testing out their voice and contribution style. Beginning to contribute content or participate in brand activities. Sharing personal experiences with the product or brand on a small scale. Active learning continues, but ambassadors start to engage with the audience in a limited capacity.

Example Actions:
Share a small number social media posts per month promoting the brand, including personal insights or stories.
Engage with Polkadot ecosystem content by commenting or sharing posts.
Join discussions and answer questions in ambassador groups or forums.
Provide feedback on products or services, participate in polls or surveys.
Create one piece of user-generated content like a blog post, photo, or video.
Attend a local meet up. 
Initial engagement in voting and discussion on OpenGov.

5.2.4 Ambassador
Consistent Engagement and Community Interaction

At this stage, ambassadors are more comfortable with the Polkadot Network and their role. They are consistently engaging, creating content, and participating in the community. Regularly engaging with their audience but not at full capacity yet. Focused on increasing their visibility and influence within the community. Actively interacting with other ambassadors and potential external partners, fostering conversations about the brand. 

Example Actions
Posting frequently about the brand across their social channels, focusing on product use or personal testimonials.
Engage regularly with other brand ambassadors by liking, commenting, or sharing their content.
Participate in brand discussions or forums, responding to questions or initiating conversations.
Increase user engagement on their content.
Representing Polkadot at conferences and events. This could be working on a booth, attending a side event, speaking at a smaller event
Hosting a local meet up

5.2.5 Lead Ambassador
Active Engagement and Contribution

At this stage, ambassadors are actively contributing and helping to spread the brand message to their audience in a more structured and frequent manner. They are more confident and understand the brand's voice, and are trusted to engage with larger audiences. Consistently creating content and engaging audiences. Contributing to the brand’s growth by driving awareness, engagement, and referrals. Actively taking part in campaigns, events, and ambassador activities.

Example Actions
Achieve a certain engagement rate on their posts
Actively host or participate in active online spaces, such as podcasts, X live spaces
Host recurring meet ups which start to foster a localised 

5.2.6 Senior Ambassador 
Leadership and Advocacy

At this level, ambassadors become brand advocates and even leaders within the community. They are now viewed as an extension of the brand, trusted to take on larger roles and contribute to more strategic initiatives. Fully integrated into the brand’s ethos and acting as a mentor to other ambassadors. Creating in-depth content and advocating for the brand at a high level. Involved in co-creating campaigns or providing strategic input. Leading discussions, training, or organising ambassador-led events.

Example Actions
Mentor X number of new ambassadors, supporting them through the onboarding process.
Speak at brand events, participate in podcasts, or lead ambassador group discussions.
Onboard an external partner, this could be an enterprise customer, developer team, external investor

5.2.7 Head Ambassador 
Brand Partner or Super Advocate

Here you enter the top tier of engagement where ambassadors become official partners or even faces of the brand. They are deeply integrated into the brand’s identity and are seen as external leaders or influencers for the company. Full ownership of their ambassador role, often tied to the brand’s core campaigns. Co-leading brand initiatives, sometimes with exclusive contracts or agreements. Influencing large audiences on behalf of the brand.

Example Actions:
Act as a brand spokesperson for campaigns, including media appearances or high-level content.
Achieve a high level of audience engagement, often in the form of sales, event participation, or large-scale social media reach.
Co-host brand-sponsored events, webinars, or podcasts.
Contribute to product innovation by providing insights or co-developing products with the brand team.

5.2.8 Grand Ambassador
Brand Icon or Elite Ambassador

This level is reserved for only the top 1-2% of ambassadors who go far beyond standard expectations. It serves as both a motivational goal for ambassadors working their way up through the program and as a way to solidify deep partnerships with those who have proven to be invaluable to the brand’s long-term success. Ambassadors at this level are not just representatives of the brand; they become synonymous with it. They are trusted to influence strategy, collaborate closely with the brand, and have the power to create a lasting impact on the brand's identity and growth. Only a select few are able to reach this level due to the high expectations, responsibilities, and impact required.

Ambassadors at this level are deeply trusted by both the brand and its audience. They consistently exceed performance targets across all KPIs. They have direct influence over the brand's image, actively shaping its marketing campaigns, messaging, and product decisions. They have a significant, loyal audience that engages regularly with their content, and their influence extends beyond the brand's immediate community and play an integral role in training, leadership, and community-building efforts.

Example Actions:
Consistently maintain high engagement rates, such as X number of likes, shares, impressions per post
Achieve major referral milestones, like driving $X+ in sales or referring X number of new customers within a specific period
Create high-quality, professional-level content, including product reviews, tutorials, or interviews with significant reach.
Act as a brand spokesperson at major events, conferences, or media appearances.
Consistently reach top-performing ambassador status across multiple metrics for an extended period.

6. Specialist Verticals

The Ambassador Fellowship is designed to be agile, resilient and empowering. The framework that will support such a programme has to be broad enough to capture the skills and vision of the masses, but be focussed enough to ensure both economic and social success whilst nurturing its members to realise their individual ambitions as Ambassadors. We have outlined the vision, mission, actions and ranks to support this goal, but we also want to ensure that the framework is used to build niche, intricate, exciting programmes that have defined goals, dedicated members and strong achievable outputs. For this, there will need to be funding of course, but also guidelines on how to build a programme that can flourish within the infrastructure that the programme provides. Here are the core principles of  the Fellowship.

Dynamic: allows for fast feedback and iteration
Inclusive: open to anyone to participate
Resilient: adapts to challenges and remains effective
Equitable: ensures fairness in the selection process
Clear: places outcomes and transparency at the forefront
Trustless: relies on on-chain mechanisms for transparency and scalability

7. Annexes, Clarifications and Amendments

Any Polkadot token holder may propose an annex (additional rule), a clarification or a non-binding convention to this manifesto. All proposals will be subject to a one month challenge period, during which time a majority ranked-vote, of the Ambassadors rank and above may vote to approve or reject the proposal. Pre-existing rules will always take precedence. Amendments must not contravene established principles and standards.


8. Rewards, Incentives and Recognition

It is important that community members feel that their fates are strongly linked to that of the Polkadot network if we are to expect a maximisation of potential. Members of the Fellowship should receive support to ensure that their short-term needs are met. We want to ensure that the long-term interests of the Polkadot Network and the individuals critical to its maintenance and development are well-aligned. Thus effective long- term incentivisation acts as both a means of pushing the members to dedicate themselves, as well as an internal compass providing some common cause which can underpin ideological alignment. 

Examples of rewards that could exist within the ranks of the programme:

Access to ambassador-only resources.
Small rewards such as discount codes, free samples, or exclusive merchandise such as ambassador-only branded gear.
Early access to upcoming product or brand news.
Feature in the brand’s ambassador newsletters or social media shoutouts
Exclusive access to new product drops, discount vouchers, or ambassador-only branded gear.
Public recognition in the brand’s ambassador community for consistent engagement.
Gifted tickets or VIP access to conferences, side events, partner events, product launches
Lifetime membership in the brand’s ambassador community, even after moving on from active duties, with ongoing perks and access.
Major rewards like cash bonuses, large product bundles, airdrops
Recognition in global campaigns or advertisements
8.2 Financial Rewards 

See Section 1.5. Members will have access to both automatic and requested funds. These funds are not dedicated to a certain type of payment but will include salaries, tips, regular recognition rewards and established programme prizes.

8.3 Onboarding, Education and Development

The program should provide a structure to nurture its members to reach their potential. Education and learning will be the cornerstone of this programme as it will have the highest impact on both its members and the Polkadot Network. Some examples of educational resources that could be made available under the Ambassador Fellowship:

Dedicated Ambassador Fellowship portal with access to  
Buddy / mentoring programme

Require also a small write-up of lessons learned at each grade, especially following the shadowing
