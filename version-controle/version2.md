# Polkadot Ambassador [Fellowship / Collective] Manifesto
### DRAFT v.2

The Polkadot Community Voices


1. The Theory 

1.1 Introduction


As the decentralisation of the Polkadot Network advances, responsibilities once managed by centralised entities must now be handled through decentralised methods. Along with this shift, new challenges will emerge that need to be identified and addressed. This article offers technical and social solutions to tackle these challenges, aiming to minimise the influence of any single participant and give DOT token holders greater control over defining needs, choosing solutions, and supporting them.

This manifesto draws on the core ideas of the Polkadot Fellowship Manifesto to suggest a new framework for an Ambassador Fellowship. Though aligned with the original manifesto's values, it addresses the unique challenges faced by this new group. It is designed to be a modest but meaningful addition to the existing framework.

While staying true to the original spirit, this proposal introduces significant changes to reflect differences in scope, candidate selection, and the evolving challenges faced by the previous Ambassador Programmes members and communities. This manifesto is a product of the community, intended to best serve the community now and in the future. By acknowledging past contributions and newer concepts, 
we will pave the way for future achievements.

1.2 Definition

Staying true to its core values and embracing decentralisation, the Polkadot Network creates the unprecedented need to rely on and support a broad network of agents and communities to accomplish various tasks and objectives - many of which remain to be identified by DOT token holders.  This approach urgently requires a robust reputation system to recognise and highlight valuable contributors. Not only will this acknowledge their efforts, but it will also improve the visibility of these key contributors both within and outside the network.


These unique challenges require creating a more dynamic programme that evolves beyond the traditional models to support agents and communities. While the programme scope should remain broad, the main goal is to provide support in four key areas:


Legitimacy
Recognition
Funding 
Inclusion in initiatives 

The programme must offer straightforward solutions to efficiently provide those resources, empowering participants to identify and address the network's needs. Since these needs will evolve unpredictably, the program should be designed so DOT token holders can retain control over the Ambassador Fellowship’s purpose and objectives, ensuring flexibility and adaptability.

DOT token holders should resist efforts to impose regulation or bureaucracy. The Ambassador Fellowship should remain resilient by design, scalable to demand, and secure in nature without compromising its integrity. 

1.3 Problems faced

While the Ambassador Fellowship does not impact the Polkadot Network's core functionality, its value lies in mastering the core components of a strong community and empowering agents to identify and tackle non-technical issues that the Polkadot Network faces. The social aspect it addresses is vital, yet expectations vary as widely as they do DOT token holders. 

Due to the multifaceted purpose of this global mission, the programme must deviate from the standards set by the Technical Fellowship, which must favour quality over quantity and strike a better balance between the technically educated and experienced and the passionate and knowledge-hungry. There will be no cap on the number of individuals joining the Ambassador Fellowship, nor a cap on any rank. To achieve a dedicated, global body burgeoning with talent, enthusiasm and a drive to make Polkadot unstoppable, the programme must be infinitely scalable, easily adaptable, empower the community with localised solutions and require minimal maintenance. 

The Ambassador Fellowship's resilience is critical for success under these metrics, so there is a separation between rank and funding.

1.4 Ranked-based membership system

We propose a new merit-based ranking system for individuals. The system will recognise all individuals who add value to the ecosystem, giving them legitimacy and incentivising future work. By doing so, DOT token holders can delegate representation of the Polkadot Network to these trusted actors. 

The true challenge is to fabricate an inclusive system that welcomes past, present, and future members while accounting for their diverse visions, skills, and levels of involvement. The ranking system should reflect the ambitious goals of the Ambassador Fellowship and the Polkadot Network, offering a clear path of advancement with increasingly rigorous criteria. 

Although the Ambassador Fellowship intends to install a resilient system requiring streamlined management in line with the decentralised future of the Polkadot Network, it must also be a system that offers guidance and direction to its leaders. Management and leadership are two separate functions. Both will be required to achieve a smooth landing in the early establishment of this initially complex process. Still, over time, the former should retract and make way for an increasingly strong set of leaders, individuals, sub-communities and specialist programme initiators. 

1.5 In Summary

The Ambassador Fellowship programme structure should:

Be a social construct first.
Be self-managing after initial establishment and running period.
Provide decorrelation of funding and rankings.
Relieve openGov as much as possible.
Bring the most value for the least possible investment or allocation of resources.

These guidelines will provide a broad spectrum framework in which the Fellowship can provide all of the above for the long-term stability and growth of the Polkadot Network.

2. The Philosophy 

The Ambassador Fellowship is a global initiative dedicated to fostering a community passionate about the vision of a decentralised web, true interoperability, and the potential of blockchain to transform our digital lives. It is a commitment to building the future of the decentralised web. 
Mirroring the mission of the protocol itself, it will be scalable, secure and resilient. 

2.1 Vision

Our vision is to create the world's largest on-chain, decentralised community, anchored in vibrancy and empowerment around a fiercely resilient core.

2.2 Values

2.2.1 Inclusivity
We believe in the power of an open and diverse community. Blockchain is for everyone, and so is the Polkadot ecosystem. We champion inclusivity by welcoming people from all backgrounds, geographies, and expertise levels to participate, collaborate, and thrive. We promote equality, recognising that our strength comes from the diversity of our members.

2.2.2 Collaboration
Interoperability and collaboration are core principles of the Polkadot Network. As individuals within the programme, we embrace this ethos by working with developers, innovators, and community members from various ecosystems. We actively encourage collaboration within the Polkadot community and across different projects and blockchains. Together, we are stronger and can achieve more.

2.2.3 Education
Knowledge is power; we are committed to being educators and stewards of accurate information. We are dedicated to spreading awareness of Polkadot’s technology, use cases, and benefits. We work tirelessly to ensure everyone, from blockchain novices to seasoned experts, can access resources and guidance that deepen their understanding of the ecosystem.

2.2.4 Integrity
We uphold the highest standards of ethics and responsibility. As Ambassadors, we represent the Polkadot Network and commit to maintaining transparency, honesty, and accountability in all our interactions. We build trust through our actions, promoting a decentralised future based on openness and fairness.

2.2.5 Innovation
Polkadot is at the forefront of blockchain technology. We are here to inspire and support creativity and innovation within the community. As Ambassadors, we are forward-thinkers, continuously exploring new ways to foster adoption, develop new solutions, and drive the ecosystem towards a future of limitless possibilities.

2.3 Mission

2.3.1 Community Building and Growth
We commit to actively engaging with local and global communities, both online and offline. We facilitate meetups, workshops, and events that connect people to Polkadot while providing resources that empower developers, creators, and enthusiasts to build and participate in the ecosystem. We expand the Polkadot community by onboarding and educating new members, particularly developers, validators, and enthusiasts in the Web3 space.

2.3.2 Education and Awareness
We are the voice and face of the Polkadot community. Whether through social media, content creation, or public speaking, we represent Polkadot’s vision and goals. We champion its innovations and ensure that accurate, valuable information reaches the widest possible audience. We enhance our understanding of Polkadot’s unique value propositions, such as interoperability, scalability, and resilience, within the broader blockchain and Web3 communities.

2.3.3 Advocacy for Decentralisation and Governance
We advocate for decentralisation not just as a technology but as a philosophy. We believe in empowering individuals to take control of their data, assets, and identity. We commit to promoting decentralised governance and decision-making, ensuring that the Polkadot network is owned and managed by its users.
We promote Polkadot’s decentralised governance model and empower communities to participate actively in Polkadot’s decision-making processes.

2.3.4 Technical Development and Ecosystem Contribution
Polkadot is a platform for developers and entrepreneurs, and we commit to supporting these builders. As Ambassadors, we help guide developers, connect them to resources, and promote their work. We play an active role in encouraging new projects to launch and thrive on Polkadot’s platform, contributing to the exponential growth of the ecosystem. We work to break down silos and foster an environment where projects across different blockchains and communities can collaborate. We encourage dialogue, cooperation and partnerships between different blockchain ecosystems, ensuring that Polkadot remains a hub for innovation and growth in the wider decentralised world.

2.3.5 Partnerships and Collaborations
Facilitate partnerships between Polkadot, its parachains, and other Web3 projects to foster cross-chain collaborations. This could be with enterprise customers, external investors, other chains, exchanges, or educational facilities.

2.3.6 Ambassador Development and Recognition
Invest in ambassadors' personal and professional growth, making them key contributors to the Web3 space.

3. The Code of Conduct

The code of conduct mirrors that of the Technical Fellowship.

Ambassador Fellowship members are expected to uphold the following tenets faithfully. Clarifications to the rules should be in agreement with these tenets. Acting in clear breach of these tenets may be considered by voters as grounds for non-promotion, demotion, or, in extreme cases, exclusion from the Ambassador Fellowship. (1) Sincerely uphold the interests of Polkadot and avoid actions that work against it. (2) Respect the philosophy and principles of Polkadot. (3) Respect the Ambassador Fellowship's operational procedures, norms, and voting conventions. (4) Respect your fellow members and the community in general, seeking to act at all times with integrity and professionalism in your interactions.

4. The Operation 

Operation rules should evolve relative to who composes the Ambassador Fellowship and be driven by the community's current needs. As much as possible, they should remain a social agreement between members of the collective, built on discussions, common consensus, and past votes. 

The operational guidelines for the Ambassador Fellowship’s membership are outlined below. They suggest the process for joining, advancing in rank, and maintaining status, at least for the program's initial phase.

All individuals can become an Ambassador for Polkadot. 
There are no limits to the number of Ambassadors at any rank
Ambassadors are expected to have achieved different levels of work and outcomes to be promoted to the next rank.
Each rank should require an ever-increasing level of involvement, dedication, and results that reflect the legitimacy the title will convey to its bearer.
The fellowship must try to relieve OpenGov from most meaningless solicitation and should embrace self-management.

4.1 Onboarding and Offboarding

4.1.1 Onboarding
As an Advocate Ambassador,  Rank 0
Ambassadors can be onboarded in two ways: (1) Through a current member of the Fellowship at any Rank above Rank 0 or (2) Self-onboard by locking one DOT on the Fellowship pallet. An educational video on how to accomplish this will be shared upon opening the programme.

At a rank higher than Advocate Ambassador, Rank 1 and above
Seeding: individuals can be onboarded into any rank through a public referendum. However, this should remain exceptional and be primarily used for the program's initial seeding and if the community needs to revoke the ranks and title of a specific agent. 

4.1.2 Offboarding
Ambassadors at any rank can remove themselves from the Fellowship by following a simple process of unlocking their one DOT. Removal will be instant. An educational video on how to accomplish this will be shared upon opening the programme.

For Ambassadors in Tier 2 and 3, there may be social constructs around how it is proper to step down and be removed from the programme, as an individual at this rank will be more deeply embedded into the programme and externally facing for a large part of the role. The Fellowship will be responsible for creating and adapting a suitable process.   

4.2 Promotion

An Ambassador at any rank may request their promotion by following the promotion process: 

All Members of one rank greater than the current rank are invited to approve or reject the request.
The window for voting is open for one month. 
A majority of rank-weighted votes (see above table) must be in favour of the promotion being approved.
If no Members have a high enough rank to affirm the promotion (always the case for promotion to rank VI), a general referendum of the Polkadot governance system must approve the promotion.
If the promotion is approved, their associated rank is incremented by one. 

To be promoted to the next rank, you need a majority vote of ambassadors who are one rank higher than the current. For example:

To become an Associate Ambassador from an Advocate Ambassador, there must be a majority vote of Associate Ambassador and above.
To become a Lead Ambassador from an Advocate Ambassador, there must be a majority vote of Lead Ambassadors and above.
To become a Global Head Ambassador, there must be a public referendum since no ranks higher.. 
In the initial seeding phase, there may not be any individuals in some of the higher ranks. In this situation, there will also be a public referendum on promoting those without anyone ranking higher than them.

By majority vote, we mean those who vote within the Ambassador Fellowship, not all potential voters. We cannot expect everyone to turn out for every vote, though there are expectations that voting turnout should increase as individuals rise up the ranks. For all votes, the requirement is more weighted voting power, yes than no.

4.3 Voting Process

The Ambassador Fellowship will favour social consensus, using on-chain voting only in cases where a consensus cannot be reached. When this is the case, the Fellowship will work with the internal programme voting system with weighted voting applied to reduce OpenGov solicitation as much as possible. 

Members of the Ambassador Fellowship should be expected to reach consensus and therefore may be required to vote on several decisions depending on the needs of the collective. For example,

Promotions and demotions
Programme treasury spending
Removals
Minor amendments to the manifesto

For clarifications or amendments to the Fellowship programme, it is expected that most will come from internal sources working within. These individuals will have access to the internal governance system and can use it accordingly. For DOT token holders that are not part of the programme and choose to remain so, all requested changes must go through Open Gov as a root referendum.   

4.4 Demotion and Removal 
There are three schools of thought surrounding a process which demotes individuals from their rank.

Ranks are supposed to represent the acknowledgement of past actions and validation from the community to encourage an ambassador to continue on their way. Still, in no way is there a promise of future work or results and because there is no opportunity cost for the treasury to maintain less active Ambassadors in the program, it does not seem to welcome the design of  an automatic demotion process. 

Ranking system with demotion with clear metrics is a must. It is certain that a percentage of people who reach this threshold will turn against the Polkadot Network through a number of unavoidable circumstances - resentment, disillusionment, attracted by a competing chain. If these people, particularly in the higher ranks, cannot be easily demoted or removed, the programme is exposed to the dangers of having negative influences within the ranks, which could impact both the mood of the collective and the external impression of Polkadot. This is particularly dangerous where there is a caveat that would allow for returning ambassadors to be promoted back to any level via governance [seeding]. 

Valuable Members could experience decay during times of necessary inactivity but be returned to their previous standing on return when deemed adequate. It would also seem more logical to have a stepped decay process than to apply the same 12 month criteria to everyone. A Global Ambassador may leave for 12 months and it is not necessary to demote them completely back to Advocate Ambassador, why not simply step them down one by one. A stepped approach will lead to a more gradual journey, both encouraging more consistent engagement from people and less risk of completely demotivating the return of quality ambassadors who do not wish to start from scratch.

The broad spectrum nature of the Fellowship mandates that the need for a demotion framework should be assessed by those in the programme upon its establishment. The three schools of thought may all have a place within this programme and the lived experience should make it clear what is necessary to encourage a culture of passion, dedication and openness within the Fellowship and wider community. Protecting and driving forward a positive reputation of Polkadot is a minimum expectation of individuals that join, self policing should occur naturally and if there is still a need for a clear demotion process, the fellowship will be able to vote internally for an amendment to this manifesto. 

DOT token holders can propose amendments through OpenGov via root referendum or request  the demotion or revocation of any Ambassador at any time via the Fellowship admin track. 

5. The Funding
5.1 Overview
The funding mechanism for the Ambassador Fellowship operates independently from the programme itself - a deliberate design choice that adds resilience and clarity. By decoupling rank from financial compensation, we create a merit-based organisation where ranks have real meaning and substance. Ambassadors earn recognition based on their contributions and only those who provide ongoing value are compensated. This fosters a culture of high-quality, long-term participation within the ecosystem, where roles are not simply honorary but are tied directly to tangible impact. Holding a title does not guarantee rewards, only results do, but the title (rank) itself serves as an aid to achieve those results.
The introduction of an Optimistic Fund to the ecosystem provides a structure designed to be flexible and scalable ensuring the Ambassador Fellowship programme can grow without being constrained by rigid or outdated funding mechanisms. Compensation is allocated through pro-rata payments, which require votes to continue, ensuring that DOT token holders maintain full control over how funds are spent. By adjusting the way funds are managed - avoiding automatic payments, requiring memos for spending, setting more targeted budgets, and dynamically selecting agents on-chain- we can reduce wasteful spending and diversify our investments into the ecosystem more effectively. This results in a more impactful, transparent use of resources.
This approach also brings security and limpidity to the program. DOT token holders have a direct say in how Ambassadors are funded, with decisions based on merit, rather than fixed entitlements. Controlled budgets and clear reporting requirements ensure that every expenditure is justified and aligned with the evolving needs of the community. This dynamic, on-chain selection adds another layer of security, ensuring that only the most qualified and effective contributors are rewarded and underperforming/bad actors can be quickly cut off from future funding.
We also create a resilient and future-proof program that can adapt to the Polkadot ecosystem’s ever-changing needs. This separation makes the Ambassador Fellowship more transparent and scalable, and allows for new programs to emerge if necessary, with funding mechanisms already in place.
For existing ambassadors, this shift in philosophy offers a more sustainable and impactful path forward. These pillars - merit-based recognition, responsible financial management and dynamic selection - represent a necessary evolution, allowing the Ambassador Fellowship to continue growing while ensuring that every contributor, and every expenditure, serves the long-term goals of the Polkadot ecosystem.
5.2 Fellowship Ambassador Treasury

The Ambassador Fellowship programme has an on-chain treasury. This treasury funds will be used to provide tooling for the programme and cover any incidental costs. When the programme is established, the top up amount and frequency will be agile depending on need. The process for requesting funds will be decided upon during the initial establishment period. The use of the funds once in the treasury will be decided through the internal Fellowship voting system. 

Examples of how the treasury may be used:

Tooling such as G-Suite, Element, Discord, premium membership for apps and social media channels
Specialist merchandise for Ambassadors
Operational emergencies 

The treasury will not be used for:

Salaries
Tipping
Specialist vertical (Section 6.2) funding
Travel expenses 
Personal expenses 

5.3 Optimistic Funding 

5.3.1 Overview
Establishing a program based around optimistic funding will ensure that immediate access to funds is available to the Polkadot ecosystem. 

An optimistic funding scheme will propose that the main Polkadot Treasury provides a sum of money, whether DOT DOT tokens and Fiat denominations, to an agnostic ‘treasury’ on a pro rata basis. In the month prior, any person/group/collective within the Polkadot ecosystem may request a portion of this treasury be allocated to them to cover their needs in the period leading up to the next pro rata payment allocation. 

Each pro rata interim, the community is given the chance to vote on where a specific batch of the optimistic funds will be directed in the next allocation. When the occasion arises where a ‘voter’ chooses not to cancel or alter their voting preference from the preceding month, their same vote would carry forward indefinitely. This operation will give necessary agility to the direction of funding allocations while not being overly burdensome to any voter base who was approving of the status quo.

All DOT token holders will have access to the Optimistic Treasury pot. All DOT token holders will vote for those that apply to the fund, so whilst it is not available only to Ambassadors, the expectation is that the community would value and allocate its resources to the necessary elements/persons of the Ambassador program as needed each pro rata period. Phragmén voting will be used to allocate all funds from the Optimistic Treasury POT. This is explained in 4.3.2.

The purpose of establishing a funding mechanism without barriers to applicants is to make it as resilient as possible. Funding mechanisms are a significant extra social & programming complication to the establishment of any program. Once a program is made in conjunction with the funding then at any time the program dies, the funding mechanism is also killed which can add levels of difficulty or even corruption. Should the community ever decide that this version of the Ambassador program has become not fit for purpose, we think it necessary that any new program which had community support could be swiftly enacted and subsequently have immediate access to funding via the independent Optimistic funding mechanism. 

5.3.2 Phragmén Voting
Definition:
Phragmén’s method seeks to solve the issue of electing a set of a given number of persons from a larger set of candidates. Phragmén discussed this in the context of a parliamentary election in a multi-member constituency; the same problem can, of course, also occur in local elections, but also in many other situations such as electing a board or a committee in an organisation.

Purpose:
The primary benefit of Phragmén voting is its ability to allocate votes and seats in a way that is more proportional and equitable, especially in multi-winner elections such as will occur with the Optimistic Treasury. Phragmén minimises the concentration of power, reducing tactical voting, and optimising vote allocation.

Also of key importance (1) it ensures diverse candidates are elected, reflecting both majority and minority support; (2) power is more evenly distributed, avoiding dominance by a single group; (3) Voters can express true preferences without needing to vote strategically (4) Votes are used optimally to maximise voter satisfaction across multiple candidates; (5) it is a scalable system - works well in complex elections and is transparent.

5.3.3 Ambassador Fellowship x Optimistic Fund Process
Each Optimistic Block (OpBlock) is valued at $10,000.
The community decides how many OpBlox should be available each month and these will then be filled automatically from the main Polkadot Treasury.
All DOT holders can apply to the Optimistic Fund. For a proposal related to the Ambassador Fellowship programme, the applicant should be from Rank 1-IV. 
Applicants can apply for multiple OpBlocks at one time.
Elections happen at equal intervals. Length will be determined as required to be beneficial to the needs of Polkadot.
Those elected get access to spend up to $10,000 USD from the treasury during their election period. 
Each spend has a required text memo field where the Ambassador describes what the funds are used for.
Elected individuals do not need to spend all the money and spending the money is not a default operation.
Elected individuals can send money to any address: to themselves for payment, salary, compensation, reward.
Elections occur on-chain, so Ambassadors need not appeal to anyone except DOT holders.
DOT holders can update their nominations based on the memos and spending history of individuals
DOT holders can update any of the parameters based on the needs of the ecosystem.

5.4 Interim Treasury [for establishment of the programme]
The programme will require an incubation period when initially created and funding will be required for this. An initial Operational Committee and Advisory Board will be established as part of a treasury proposal which requests these funds. Once DOT holders have voted in favour of this, the Committee and Board Members will set out how the funds will be used to support the programme and its Members for success during the incubation period. The manner in which the funds are dispersed should mirror that of the Fellowship Treasury and Optimistic Fund to demonstrate how the programme will run effectively when the incubation period is over.

OpenGov is always accessible to Ambassadors as it is to every DOT holder. 

6. The Ranking System

6.1. Ranking

Creating broader categories of engagement for the Ambassador Fellowship ranking system will act to guide participants through a progressive journey from passive learning to active and meaningful contributions. These levels help structure the Ambassador's growth and can be tied to increasing responsibilities, incentives, and impact. The importance of having such a range in which an individual can engage with the Fellowship lies in building a programme that will be resilient to outside factors such as directional changes within Polkadot, talent pool fluxes and economic pressures. The programme should be open to all Polkadot enthusiasts and embrace the vibrancy of ideas and energy it will bring.

6.2 Ranking Requirements 

Advocate Ambassador (Rank 0)
One absolute requirement is for an individual to begin their journey with the Ambassador Fellowship. They must become registered on-chain. To do this, they will take the following steps:

Open a wallet, become verified, lock 1 DOT
Introduce themselves in the Polkadot Forum and any other channels designated to Ambassador dialogue 

We will provide simple guidelines to walk individuals through each step to ensure the barrier to entry makes this Fellowship accessible to all.

Advocate Ambassadors are newly engaged Members of the Fellowship. This is the period in which an individual begins their journey of learning about the Polkadot Network and being immersed in the Fellowship and the wider Polkadot community. Education and engagement are the key focuses at this entry rank and for this reason, there are no specific expectations. Individuals should still consider that they are part of the on-chain Ambassador Fellowship, so should abide by the Code of Conduct (Section 3) and should have a positive outlook on Polkadot and the ambition to increase their engagement with the network.

The first active rank is the Associate Ambassador, Rank I. To progress to Rank 1, Associate Ambassador, the individual will need to have started their learning journey and decided to embark on an active learning process with the ability to demonstrate that learning within the community.

The ranking system is divided into three tiers, each aligned with behaviours associated with this role. These behaviours and resulting actions are broad-spectrum, based on the natural evolution of the learning and development process.  

6.2.1 Tier A: Listening, Learning and Demonstrating Understanding

Associate Ambassador (Rank I)
Listening and Learning about the Polkadot Network and the Community

Lead Ambassador (Rank II)
Initial engagement with the Polkadot Community 

6.2.2 Tier B: Active Engagement

Senior Ambassador (Rank III)
Actively Engaging with the Polkadot Community and Growing External Networks

Principal Ambassador (Rank IV)
Helping External Partners Navigate the Polkadot Ecosystem, Cross-Chain Collaboration, Fellowship Programme Management

6.2.3 Tier C: Leadership and Innovation

Global Ambassador (Rank V) 
External Partnership Lead, Fellowship Programme Process Design 

Global Head Ambassador (Rank VI)
Globally Recognised Voice of Authority, Strategically Aligning the Fellowship Programme with Polkadot Leadership

6.3 Metric Guidelines for Promotion

The metrics used to demonstrate success and allow for individuals to be promoted are flexible to align with the Ambassador Fellowship, which supports the versatility and scalability of the Polkadot Network.  To avoid being too prescriptive, there are guidelines on measuring whether an individual is in a position to be promoted. These guidelines can be both widely interpreted and mark key areas where engagement is likely to remain key for the success of the Polkadot Network. These areas may change over time and can be realigned with any changes in the Polkadot roadmap accordingly.

6.3.1 Overview

There are six key areas of appraisal for promotion. As individuals climb the ranks, they are assessed in more areas.

6.4 Rank Voting 

Voting will happen through weighted rank voting. This simply means that Ambassador Fellowship member votes are weighted by their rank. Ambassadors at Rank I, Advocate Ambassadors, will not be able to vote. Ambassadors at Rank I-VI, Associate Ambassador to Global Head Ambassador, will have their votes weighted as follows.

7. The Evaluation 

In digital systems, decisions are designed to be straightforward and unambiguous. Yet, achieving consistent and fair judgments becomes far more complex when it comes to social systems like law, education, or corporate hierarchies. The delicate balance between the rule-makers intentions and the need for clarity often proves elusive, as history has shown numerous failures to maintain it. While our focus here lies on the technical facets of blockchain technology, it's essential to recognize that not every decision can be made with pure objectivity when evaluating people. Human judgement is still crucial. To navigate this, we promote open discussion and provide a basic framework to guide voters consisting of two components: broad considerations that apply across all ranks and specialist verticals that serve Polkadot's evolving needs. These verticals will mandate their deliverables and KPIs, operating as sub-programmes of the Fellowship.

7.1  Common Expectations

7.1.1 Fellowship Contributions
There will be a broad and constantly evolving range of contributions that an individual can make to promote the Polkadot Network but to be promoted up the ranks, there should be increasing input from its members to improve the programme. For example:

Plentiful teaching, education, and rational advocacy are crucial to moving through the later ranks.
The individual has actively promoted and grown the programme by recruiting, onboarding and assisting in promoting new members.
Regular voting is part of the programme to assist the efficiency of the promotion period and other mechanisms that require Ambassadors to vote. Increased voting should be reflected in rising ranks.

7.1.2 Social Interactions
These are consideration points when evaluating social interactions with other members. Once again, to be evaluated comparatively to other members already of the prospective rank
The individual can listen, comprehend, and form a compelling dialectic
The individual avoids ego, pointless argumentation, or repeatedly pushing against an answered point. 
The individual is not afraid of calmly and succinctly challenging others when doing so would lead to their greater understanding of the world.
The individual is persistently and consistently making themselves available for the support of the network. 

7.2 Specialist Verticals 

7.2.1 Overview
The Ambassador Fellowship is designed to be resilient and versatile, empowering Members to be creative when looking at solutions and innovations that support the ever evolving path of the Polkadot Network. The framework that will support such a programme has to be broad enough to capture the skills and vision of the masses but be focused enough to ensure both economic and social success whilst nurturing its members to realise their ambitions as Ambassadors. We have outlined the vision, mission, actions and ranks to support this goal. Still, we also want to ensure that the framework is used to build niche, intricate, exciting programmes with defined goals, dedicated members and achievable solid outputs. For this, guidelines are provided on building specialist vertical programmes that deliver within the overarching Ambassador Fellowship's infrastructure. 

7.2.2 Core principles
Dynamic: allows for fast feedback and iteration
Inclusive: open to anyone to participate
Resilient: adapts to challenges and remains effective
Equitable: ensures fairness in the selection process

8. Annexes, Clarifications and Amendments

Any Ambassador may propose a clarification or an amendment to this manifesto. In line with the Polkadot Technical Fellowship manifesto, all proposals will be subject to a one-month challenge. During that time, a majority ranked-vote of the Ambassadors rank and above may vote to approve or reject the proposal. Pre-existing rules will always take precedence. Clarifications and amendments must not contravene established principles and standards. 

If an Ambassador wants to propose an annex, then this must be submitted through Open Gov as a root referendum. If a DOT holder who is not part of the Ambassador Fellowship does not want to join the programme but wishes to propose an annex or any other changes, including the closing down of the programme, this must also be done through Open Gov as a root referendum.
